The Tris example comes with an Extension provided in two versions: Java and JavaScript (Tris and Tris-JS respectively).
You can choose which one to use by enabling the corresponding constants in the “LobbyController.cs” file under “/client/Tris/Assets/TrisAssets/Scripts" folder.
By default the Java Extension is used.
