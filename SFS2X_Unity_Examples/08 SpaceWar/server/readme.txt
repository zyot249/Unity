The SpaceWar example comes with an Extension provided in two versions: Java and JavaScript (SpaceWar and SpaceWar-JS respectively).
You can choose which one to use by enabling the corresponding configuration in the Zone configuration file under "/server/Zone" (please note that you will need to set both the Room and Zone configuration).
By default the Java Extension is used.
